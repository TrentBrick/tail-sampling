[WP] The family that preys together, stays together. 
 The family reunion should've ended during the day. Even if it could n't stop right then and there, it should've stayed in the park.

 I thought we were friends.
 
 No, I'm not going to pretend that it didn't happen. I didn't tell my parents because I wanted them to see it was wrong. 
 
 I still have the scars on my stomach, the bruises from when I hit him, and the bruises on my arm, but they don't bother me anymore.
