Prompt: 
 
[WP] A boy asks a girl out. It's high school. It's awkward. Narrate it from the point of view of a nature documentary. 
 And here we see the first of several stages of mating rituals in the humans. 
 
 The first is often the most unsuccesful in creating long term relations, yet mostly serves as practice for future, more significant rituals. Perhaps ironically, this first mating ritual is more complicated than any of the others, often occurring

 during sex. 

In his study on romantic love , writer William B. O'Neill describes how men have these feelings of love and concern for one another even before they become intimate with another man. O'Neill's focus is on the ways in which men make their sexual encounters socially acceptable in their society. 

They must demonstrate their love and concern for one another by sharing intimate moments, sometimes including physical contact. The type of moments that are most appropriate to encourage such "anxiety" and to help ensure the bond between two men is not broken is something called a positive impact on sexual encounters. 

There are a number of other behaviors that may indicate a healthy human relationship, like the shared delight at seeing a new

  The second stage is a highly effective ritual. It provides the motivation to begin a new relationship. 
 
 
 The third is often the most traumatic for the man, yet is usually not repeated. It is the process of forming an intimate, life-long relationship, and for many, it is the only time they truly know they are loved and accepted. 
 
  The fourth stage is the most destructive, but also sometimes the most successful. 
 
 The fourth stage is often the least traumatic and is a moment of recognition for the man, who then

 more like symbolic rituals than the rest of their kind. 
The next stage is sometimes the most successful, and as such sometimes of more significance, even if it is rarely accepted as real. Here, the first ritual is frequently taken up to suggest the ultimate goal and purpose of future social relationships. However, even if it is very well planned and executed, it often leaves the participants confused about precisely what they believe is their ultimate goal. 
 It can also leave them confused about the meaning of their interaction. I'll have more to say on a different level later. As I mentioned, humans are a fascinating species. They are a highly complex group of beings living in an otherwise homogenous environment. I think that this observation might be the
