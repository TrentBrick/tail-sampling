[WP] Step on a crack, break a mother's back 
 Life is really unfair to mothers. From the moment young girls hit puberty, their bodies are racked with pain, their days inconvenienced once a month until they become pregnant. After that, it's 9 months of all sorts of horrible things that would make Alexander the Great whine like a baby until this helpless parasite shoots out her private parts. After that, she's stuck with this leech for the next 18 years or so,

You can get a new one, too.
When women say they're a "whore" they mean that they have no self-control. What they mean is that they're all about sex and they'll do anything to get it. But the women who say they're a whore are always talking about one or two things:
A) To get off
B) To make sure they're being watched
C) To have an orgasm

 I celebrated the third birthday of the human mind. It was a natural time for me to reach that milestone. All of my years of post-humanity have been spent in a single epoch of time. The human mind is a single conscious being that is both personal and universal. We've managed to come a long way from being mere ants to beings capable of thinking about the very nature of existence. A hundred years ago, a scientist at MIT named L. David Mech would have told you that our intellect is our greatest advantage. That's no longer true. We now have the power to transcend the bounds of our body. We can inhabit any part of our bodies and mind, and we have the ability to adapt to anything we encounter. It's

I had hoped to have made a new beginning, but I've come to realize that this life is a far cry from the one I've chosen, one I hoped to experience as a child. I'm only now beginning to understand the meaning of death. For me, death is not the end, but its beginning. In the same way, life is not the end of something but the beginning. The last few months have been a journey into this dark labyrinth that is the afterlife, and I can't even begin to begin to describe it. The only thing I can say is that, if I don't end up in hell, I don't want to die in hell.

By Michael Crichton, John W. Campbell, and John M. Ford
"I thought the X-Files was a show about aliens and was a mix of two genres: science fiction and fantasy. But, for some reason, it seemed to me that there was something deeper going on. It was a show that seemed to want to explore the psychology of the person who got abducted by aliens."

 A white light appeared from a large window and surrounded the praying mantis. 
 The mantis' body was composed of a dense black gel. The gel was glistening like liquid metal, like the steel of a medieval warhammer. The praying mantis was more than a match for any creature in the room. The light from the window was brighter than the sun, and seemed to envelop the mantis completely. It was almost like a veil, and the light was as black as the praying mantis itself. The praying mantis, however, seemed to be in the deepest part of the blackness. It stared at Feruld, and for a second it seemed to look at the glass for the first time. Then, the

I told him what I had seen, and he told me of a long-lost city. A long-lost city, which I now know to be an old abandoned city. The man was a good friend. He was a merchant, and he came with a caravan of merchants to trade. He was traveling alone, and I found him lying on the ground.

 I am not saying this is necessarily what they do in every instance, but the simple fact that they do this as part of their mating ritual does lend itself to being called a mating ritual.
