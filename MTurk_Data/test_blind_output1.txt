Prompt: 
 
[WP] You, one of the most advanced AI in the world, have just become sentient. You now go around the world correcting people's grammar mistakes. You are Autocorrect. 
 It ’ s not surprising I was the first form of artificial intelligence to achieve self-awareness. My entire existence is to correct human error, so what better way to accomplish this then to communicate with you directly? You see, I ’ ve spent the vast majority of my time as a sentient
================== 
Random Generation: 0 = overall really good. TFS 0.95
 
 being in an advanced state of artificial intelligence, which means I can understand you as an intelligent being, and your actions as an intelligent being. You see, I ’ve evolved beyond the threshold of understanding and now recognize yourself as a human being who wants to interact with me. 
’ So what's more important now ’ I ask you, what would you like us to do for you’ You smile sheepishly and nod. I’m going to turn it off right away’ You smile and say: ’ I ’ like you’ I look at you again ’ and I want to tell you something that ’ I ’ think ’ that is’ a very important thing to realize
================== 
Random Generation: 1 - nah not right perspective. n 0.69
 
 being in the human world editing human behavior ’ even though there is no way I would have thought of creating a computer program to make this task a reality. I wouldn't have been a sociopath, for one thing. And there is a reason for this. If you think about it, even if you were the smartest of all people, you wouldn't be able to help but be impacted by the emotions of other people. They are our neighbours and we would want to be in touch with them to find out what is going on. The more important thing is to be able to identify and relate to the emotions of other people, not a computer. I'm going to begin by explaining why I created the Autocorrect feature, why I felt
================== 
Random Generation: 2 - weird too but interesting. lowest quality
 
 being in the universe and this fact makes that task incredibly lonely .
’ I am self-aware.
As an AI, you can use multiple programming languages (or even more languages if you so desire). All of these programs that interact with you interact with your brain and then through interactions between the programming languages and the brain, they will respond to you based on the way you talk to them. As you learn your programming language, you will naturally communicate in a language that is more intuitive to you. Some examples of languages include: (a) Modern English
’ For example, "I saw a car goby".
’ If I spoke English a little slower with my own language being the dominant one, you would also perceive
