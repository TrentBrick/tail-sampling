 Could this be it? I could have sworn, no... no this can not be the same one. But it has the same smell, the same feel. I thought I lost it, my most treasured prize. How sweet a reunion this is... 
 
 
 Uh oh, one of the big ones are coming. The one with long hair is not going to be pleased that I dug this hole. Should

 I just ignore that and jump right in? 
 

 
 
 

"Don't leave me here!", I hear a voice, the tone almost annoying. I move closer and open the door. I'm not looking because the feeling inside of me seems to have awoken... but it's my first time here and, well, I guess I am used to it.

I kept pushing the fire away from the pit, but I couldn't stop it, because it was definitely in trouble. It was getting closer to the crater. The fire couldn't keep it from turning to flame. I was going to give
