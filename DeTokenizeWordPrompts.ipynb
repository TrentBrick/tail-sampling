       "\"[TT] ``Shut the dog up. '' \\n “Shut the dog up, ” shouted my head officer from the jeep. The dog was running circles around our vehicle, barking at the people inside. The officer tapped my shoulder and pointed to the yellow, skinny animal circling our jeep. \\n \\n“ But sir.., ” I managed to spit out before he took both his hands and pushed me out of the vehicle. I went tumbling out, and landed on the rough sandy ground. I stood up adjusting the gun hanging from my shoulder and proceeded to walk towards the canine. The dog stopped its barking, and shifted its black eyes to me. \\n \\n “Come here little pup. Hey come here, I ’ m not going to hurt ya, ” I said trying to coax it nearer to me. Actually, I didn ’ t know if I was going to hurt the little mutt or not yet. Reaching my hand towards my waist, I pulled off a tiny bit of my rations. I held it out my hand, with the ration laying on my open palm. The dog perked it ’ s ears, and came a few inches closer to me. Ever so slightly the skittish animal moved its way closer to my hand. At first only a couple inches, then a foot closer, until finally its snout was centimeter from my hand. I could see the small flecks of sand coating its fur. I pushed the ration closer to its teeth. \\n \\n“ GRUNT, ” the sound of my officer ’ s voice rang out, scaring the dog away. A shot rang out, and the dog ’ s body spasmed. The dog kept running, while blood trailed behind him. The blood leaving a streak in the sand. It kept running into the desert, and then promptly collapsed. It sides heaved one last breath, and then went flat. \\n \\n I stood up, turned towards the jeep and just stared. \\n \\n “Grunt, get back in the jeep, were running off schedule, ” the Head officer yelled at me. \\n“ Yes sir, right away sir, ” was all that came out of my mouth. As I walked back to the jeep, pictures of the dog ’ s death ran through my head. I stepped up into the cab and sat down. We drove off, but I didn ’ t keep watch like I was supposed too. My eyes were fixed on the dog. \\n\""

       "\"[WP] Leonardo DiCaprio in a fit of rage begins to torpedo his own career by deliberately acting poorly and taking on bad films. He finally wins an oscar for starring in Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3. \\n The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time. Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings. His eyes fluttered. Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor, contorting his aching body into a cross legged position. Last night was bad. He gathered that. His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories. He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort. \\n He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was. His investigation was n't entirely fruitless, he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka. It was cheap but would definitely get the job done. Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up. \\n There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself. It was a game he'd play with himself, glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back. If he did n't know better he'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman, or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling. \\n His face was portly and unshaven, in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard. His stomach was round but firm, like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated. The hair was long and unruly, receding far into the past. But his eyes were the giveaway. Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity. It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger. Still sharp enough to cut. \\n ``DiCaprio. ''The curse rasped out of him in a choke. After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there. Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money. Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him. \\n Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. \\n His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming\""
