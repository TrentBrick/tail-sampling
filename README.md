Here is all of my analysis for the Tail Free Sampling Blog post: <https://trentbrick.github.io/Tail-Free-Sampling/>

If you are interested in using Tail Free Sampling, see [this repository](https://github.com/TrentBrick/TailFreeSampling) for an implementation in Tensorflow (tested up to 1.14 but should also work for 2.0). This code should also be trivial to implement in Pytorch.
