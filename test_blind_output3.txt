 I fall hard on the pavement. Taking a few seconds, I scramble to my feet, coughing smoke out of my lungs. The weapon is a few feet away. It ’ s a large syringe filled with a purple liquid. I

"What were you thinking?" my girlfriend's voice comes from the other side. There are only a few close supporting anchor points in the building, several smaller caves cut off from each other with impassable metal wall. Good thing my Mom isn't around, huh? Looks like a broken clock is an actual time tracker now. "You made my eyes hurt. Bluk-Bri-Oop." 
She licks her fingers on the wound. "That's OK. You don't´t have to deal with me anymore when I get home for a while, OK?" 
I grin at the

 open my mouth to try and scream out what I can. I'm really sorry, I really am. I'm not sorry. It's true. I am sorry for killing a child. 
A sharp edge cuts across my neck. For a second I feel as though we've collided, as though the bullets had come right through my skull, the bullet lodged deep in my neck and still somehow lodged itself there, the bullets sliding off and over my body. With the pain seeping through my chest, I try to scream but my voice is so weak, so broken, the only thing that comes out is my voice so close to cackling, so desperate I almost drown it out with laughter. The blade cuts through my neck, and

 distill through the glass into a drop that I add to to both of my empty bottles. The pain rrenches my arms tight, my fingers wrap around my ripped wrists and elbows. Behind me, the syringe trails along the pavement. The next thing I know, my hand falls to the pavement, but falls impossibly calmly into the syringe. Then everything twists around. I'm lifted into the syringe, my hand vents a holo-blot of my eyes on myself. My body is consuming the wicker-work that forms the walls of this small steel wound. The thought that my mind is mine only rears its head with that vaunted metamorphosis, hiss of anger growling with every shift of momentum.

 I crawl to the side of the road and begin to pray. 
 
 I feel something strange. 
 

The syringe drops into my stomach. 
 
The purple liquid floats down my stomach and reaches my heart. I feel the liquid engulf my heart. I don't know what to do. I know that the syringe has killed me, but I don't know what to do about it. I have no idea how to stop the syringe from entering my heart. 
 
I begin to scream again. I'm not sure if I can even hear myself scream. I don't know what to do

 open my mouth and exhale slowly, hoping that the air is still enough to get it in my lungs, but that nothing of use will get out. 
            I feel like it's time to find a way out, to finish this. I stick out my hand and pull out a flashlight. By the time I realize what it is, the cops have arrived. They rush over to me, to make sure I am OK, but of course, they don't seem interested. They decide that it would be futile to go too far into a police station and try to arrest me, in case I hurt them, and instead turn their attention to trying to stop the scent in my bag. So I just walk back to the corner of

I look at the syringe. The syringe is empty. There's something in the syringe. I try to reach to it. The pain is too great. There isn't enough blood. The syringe is empty. I can't even reach it. It's gone. I turn around and look for the weapon. It's gone. My blood is running from the wound on my neck. I look up. The sky is dark. The sky is blue. I don

            The car takes off with the bag as its back. It doesn't stop. I can feel the bag still in my chest. I have no idea how long I've been running, but somehow, I seem to be breathing faster. I'm a breath away from choking on something metallic, but instead of choking, I'm just able to nod in satisfaction.
