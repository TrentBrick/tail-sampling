Prompt: 
 
[WP] Each village has a designated ``scapegoat ''that everyone takes their issues out on. Write about the life of this person. 
 We called her Dirt 
 because no one can love dirt. 
 We did n't call her Earth, 
 because no one can hate Earth, 
 no one but Dirt, 
 because she was n't Earth. 
 You can disregard Dirt, 
 unload your sorrow, your strife 
 your thirsty,
================== 
Random Generation: 0 - super repeat. 
 
 your weeping  your empty and unkempt 

and give a song to her; 
"Let me sing her out, Let me sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  and sing her out  
================== 
Random Generation: 1 - okay
 
 your cold
 your heart-broken heart, your bruised, your sick, but the pain of her name is on your skin. You cannot make her go away  because she is dirt again,  like when you see her,  she is still dirt. You cannot forgive her because you have never forgiven you, because you were not dirt before you saw her. All you can do is to let her go now so she can go where no dirt has gone before, and this new dirt has no more purpose but to give to others. 
Treatment is only when this new land is used for a living.
To be fair, sometimes it's harder to let someone go. But even then,  let her go be the only thing
================== 
Random Generation: 2 - nah not as good. but these are too context dependent? 
 
 nessy emotional nessiness onto her, 
 as we did Dirt.
Then we are ready to go. 
Time to make something good of ourselves. 
Read the story of how Dirt was born. 
Dirt was born by Dirt and Dirt was born by Darn. 
Ditch to Ditch is The Child's Promise to the World,
a monument to everything we love and everything we hate. 
This will not happen with only two words. 
With a lifetime of dialogue. 
With the full force of the universe and all the love that life has to offer. 
Let's work together and the rest will follow. 
What is Time? 
 It

I am judging more on the context than the content!
