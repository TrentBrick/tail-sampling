Prompt: 
 
[WP] Everybody who turns 25 learns a reality shattering secret about the world. Nobody has ever leaked this secret to somebody under 25. Today is your 25th birthday. 
 I am 25 today. And that also means I get my secret. My eyes flickers to the door when I hear a knock and I opened to see a guy with a piece of paper. He wears the black uniform of the new police and I take it. 
 
 ``Remember, you ca n't

``I promise, I will.''
 ``No. Don't promise. Promise.''
``I'm 21.''
``Don't say a word.''
``I promise.''
I'm a really bad teacher, but that's what this man is. He's a former spy, a former CIA agent, and a former FBI agent. He's a world famous blogger and I take his hand and tell him I know his secret. 
 
``Your secret is?''
``I'm not going to tell you.''
``You can't, because it would ruin your life.''
``You don't understand. You

 The guy puts the paper on my head and I get the message. 
 
 ``This is the key to the city and I don't want to lose this.'' 
 
 ``Do what you need to do.'' 
 I look at him and he says, ``We're not doing anything. You're just being helpful. If I want to find a man with a gun, I have to do something. That's the way it is.'' 
 ``Yeah, I know. That's just what I thought. I didn't even know there was a key to the city. I thought it was a key to the door.''

[WP] A character gets control over his stats like in a videogame and pours all of it into luck 
 I was n't really expecting this opportunity, but when I opened the GUI to my stats to spend a few skill tokens, I was shocked to discovered that I had 6000 tokens. That's enough to max my swords, bows, and armor—all of them! I really wanted to spend it straight away, but alas my sensibility took control.

 I thought, ''How many coins will it cost?'' 
 ``It is hard to say. In a game where the most valuable equipment is gold, it would be more expensive to invest in the gold. If you are a cheap character, it is easy to spend your tokens on a better weapon or armor.'' 
 
 ``However, if you are an extremely powerful character and you invest a lot of tokens into the gold, you might be able to get better items, especially if you have the money to buy a boat from the market

As I contemplated the use of the beam, I decided to go back and check on the other occupants. After I had left the other occupants I returned, feeling somewhat better after a nap, and noticed that I had left the two people I had been in contact with behind. The girl seemed to be sleeping, though it wasn't quite as she had been.

The god of a man lifted his chin up. ``Because I don't know what you're going to do with your powers. I'm not going to judge you for that. You have a lot of potential and you should go out and learn how to use them.''

(WP) Blatant Magic vs. Subtle Magic 
 I've always had a knack. Not for brains, nor for sports in particular. Just a knack. I first noticed it when i was about 9, my friend told me about this cool toy he'd heard about. I always remember this moment as when it began, you'd think i'd be able to remember that darn toy, but no. I knew i would remember it then either, so i decided to write it down.

 Now, there's probably a lot wrong with that statement, but i'm pretty sure that what i wrote was a pretty accurate representation of what happened. The more I wrote, the more i began to think that this thing was magical. The more i read, the more i began to understand how magical it really was, how amazing it was, the more i realized just how special this thing was, and it was getting me excited all over again. It was very early on, so i can't really claim to have an exact recollection. I don't know what i was thinking. I guess it's all in my head, but it's like nothing I have ever experienced. In fact, i would argue that i've had some of the best

This is the start of my career as a magician, when i realized i was to be a part of something special. I was too young to realize it at the time, but in my heart i knew i was meant to be a part of something bigger. As i said, I had a knack. So, it was only natural that i should learn
