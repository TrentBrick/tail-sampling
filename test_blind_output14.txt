Prompt: 
 
[WP] A veteran Holocaust Jewish survivor meets a man in the elevator. As they strike a conversation, he slowly realizes the man was his brutal Nazi prison warden. 
 It was a boiling hot day, abnormally hot for spring. Walking into the lobby of the hotel I was staying in was somewhat disappointing, the air conditioning was still broken. As a result, I took the lift. I'd have normally taken the stairs, but not in this weather, not at my age.

I walked down the elevator and went through the door. My mind raced. It was early morning. It was spring. The sun was up. What was I going to do? I wanted to stay up late, watch the sunrise, make the kids laugh. I wanted to enjoy the view. I wanted to see the sun and have my cake and eat it too.

The elevator door opened, and the second man, who looked like he was about a decade younger than I, was standing at my entrance steps. Looking pretty much the same at that point, I nodded. I've never heard of a Holocaust veteran dying from elevator assault before.

            As soon as the lift stopped and the elevator door opened, the door burst open and I stepped out onto the sidewalk. 
            After a few seconds, I felt a sharp pain on my right shoulder. 
            I turned my head in order to see what it was, and I saw the back of my left shoulder sticking out of the ground, like a stick of gum. 
            I started to look around frantically, looking for whatever it was. I didn't really see anything. I started to scream, but I couldn't get it out. I tried to grab my coat, but I felt my arm get stuck between the coat and the ground, and I couldn't move
