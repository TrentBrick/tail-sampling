    "Get the difference between nucleus and TFS set of words. See if the words in this set are reasonable. They should be reasonable for when TFS is looser and should not be when TFS is tighter. Out of this set of words, take the highest, lowest prob ones and the middle one? Need at least 3 word gap between them. \n",
    "Rank each one in how reasonable it is. Control baseline is how reasonable words at different points in the body are. The first word, half way and at the closer of the tails. Can also get words outside of the last tail, just outside, halfway to the end, and at the very end. \n",
    "There are 9 different words in total. Should i rank all of them, scramble up a subset? Or have a ranking for each of the subsets differently? Probably scramble them all up. And then present 3 of them??\n",
    "Can then see overall how replaceable different parts of the distributions is, and for TFS and nucleus specifically. Have a control with the bad words. And should be able to hopefully show that the difference in replaceability between the TFS and nucleus words is small when TFS is looser and large when TFS is tighter. Can see how specific this is also. Eg could just look at the last TFS and nucleus words, see the diff in replaceability, or maybe need to look at the averages. Look most at this unique subset and these three points should hopefully categorize it. Want them because i dont know how good the signal is going to be. For the closest words for example. \n",
    "Can also get overall data on how replaceability corresponds to model probability. \n"
