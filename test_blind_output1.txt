Prompt: 
 
[WP] Monsters under the bed exists and the world knows. This is your first night at a new job: the nightly security guard at the local bed store 
 Night at the Museum, Five Nights at Freddy's, The Monster Under My Bed… Those were all works which flashed through my mind as I made my way through the emptying parking lot. The store was technically closed, the last customers filtering out. When I told my friends what my new job was, they thought my uniform looked

 like a naked zombie.

I had to admit, I was a little surprised when I got the call from the town. The other night, the freaky Zombie Lord had been killed. The doctor had said that the Zombie Lord was a mutated version of the One-Eyed Zombie, but that he had been unleashed by the mass media and was now in a coma. The town was accusing the Zombie Lord of being responsible for the deaths of the other residents.

"What's wrong with the town?" I asked.

"I don't know, but they're starting to get worried."

"I'm not sure what they're talking about, but they're definitely worried. I'm not sure if they're going

 strange. Well, I wasn't the first to wear this uniform. This was the uniform of a guard at the local bed store, where I'd be working on my first night at the museum. There had to be something odd about it… I knew a lot about this place, so it was my job to keep it safe. I did my best to make sure the guard would know where to look in the security office and to ensure that it was kept in order. This was my job.

Night at the Museum, Five Nights at Freddy's, The Monster Under My Bed… The guard's eyes widened as he took in the sight before him. A young man sitting on the floor of an office, a pair of glasses resting in

 ridiculous because of my long black hair and my red shirt, but it's not like that. It's just that, for me, that night at the museum was the first time I truly experienced the joy of being a young girl, the joy of being young and not being old at all, the joy of having my mind and body at the mercy of a new job and a young girl with my own dreams and ambitions, the joy of being free and being loved without having to fear rejection. My new job wasn't like any other job I'd had in the past, I had never had to go home and find someone who knew how to dress like me or be comfortable wearing something like my clothing (it's like I was born with the ability

 strange. The day had been nice and sunny, but the weather had been awful, the wind and rain had made it impossible to see where I'd parked. I figured if I did well enough, I could take care of myself and come back. That was a fantasy, I had no intention of staying for long. I decided to take a walk around town and see what was going on in the other parts of town. My friends had left to catch some dinner and I was getting ready for it when they called me.

I came upon a man dressed in dark clothing, carrying a clipboard and a folder. "Hello, this is Mr. Krusty, I'll be your driver today. Will you take me to the Museum of

 ridiculous because I was tall and tall. It did however shock me that it actually gave me jobs to do. It was like picking up a needle and thread: Sometimes, it could be worth it in a night.

My next stop was the toy store: Toy shop come, toy shop come. When I heard the new level drop as well as the mechanical doors of the smaller one, they gave me hope that things were finally turning around. At first, I was upset to find a world not comprised of Noodles and Bettys toys. Now I was excited and apeshit excited to get back to painting, and simply loving life. In the five hours or so, I have used (and passed in

 weird and I was in an emergency room. But then I looked up to the window and saw that the entire street was covered with a huge sheet of ice and the rest of the building was frozen over. I was standing around the corner, watching the empty street as we walked through the snow toward the parking lot. I was so glad that I had my camera. 
That's when I saw a flash of light. 
My first thought was that it was a reflection of a camera. But then I realized that my head was being illuminated and the flash could have been a camera. I turned around and saw a young girl and two boys standing outside the door. As I closed the door the two boys began to yell and yell and yell

 strange. Well, I wasn't the first to wear this uniform. This was the uniform of a Night at the Museum employee. He didn't wear the same pants every day, but the overall pattern was the same and was pretty standard to begin with. There were two uniforms I had worn in the past: One of the men was white, blue, black and pink. The other was black with white detailing. It was hard to tell what it was because I was not wearing it, but it was definitely different than what I wore. The black suit, the black shirt, the black tie. I had the same shirt. The suit was actually the same thing as all the other Night at the Museum employees, but the tie was different. It

 ridiculous, but they all agreed it was cool. I walked through the hallways and into the elevator, the familiar music playing in the background. I heard the buzzer go off and the elevator door shut behind me.
"You look great!" I exclaimed as I took off my pants. I felt so relaxed and relaxed, I could hardly believe I was in a real place. I quickly turned around and looked around, seeing the museum. I was in a huge hallway, with a large, white-roofed room. It was quite spacious, the room being huge enough to fit two people. There was a big stage, and a large poster of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza on the wall, with a giant smiley face.

 ridiculous because of my long black hair and heavy mop, while those of them who had seen me prior to work, said I looked just normal. They also thought I looked like someone had just come out of a hospital ward with an open wound. They are right though, having read all that, I have had my fill and was ready to leave the building. To my surprise the day was just as busy as the night before. More people walked by than in the previous hours, and they seemed more open minded. A few of my acquaintances also looked more friendly as they noticed that I had gone out of my way to make their way to work. It was odd how everyone had such a pleasant attitude towards me even when they didn't have my

 ridiculous, but they all agreed it looked cool and I knew I could make a living there. For the next few months, I kept this odd routine of riding my bike to and from work, fixing parts to what looked like an expensive collection of guitars and basses.

The events of Five Nights at Freddy's would break my immersion with new game mechanics in order to move through the park and find the trigger event for a password that would unlock a door or option to avoid in a sequence of events. It was not until I received a contract and asked my supervisor if I could work in retail and fulfill the contract that I would be able to speak freely with the rest of the staff. They came to me with a lead and confirmed that the

 weird. I was glad they didn't think I was a monster.

The only thing I could think of was that I was supposed to be the new security guard at the local bed store. I was sure I was supposed to be a security guard at the store, but I was also sure I was supposed to be a monster.

I walked through the parking lot, hoping to find a place to sleep. I didn't want to go to the bed store, but I knew I could find a place to sleep. I was a bit nervous, but I knew I could do it. I had a few hours to kill, and I knew I could do it.

I walked into the back of the store, and saw

 ridiculous because of my enormous black makeup and wavy blonde hair.


It was the most surreal day of my life. I took my seat at my desk with the glass window overlooking the sea of customers who were filling the giant cubicle. A security guard came out on the balcony and waved me into the dark parking lot and invited me into his office. Under his heavy, black coat was a set of blue gloves, a pink or purple long sleeved t-shirt, and a black and white polka dot bowtie. He started tugging the waistband of his shirt down over my waist, exposing me from below. After pulling down his black slacks and wearing something less extreme, he cut my front and shaved his chest and finished
