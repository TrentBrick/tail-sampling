Hillary's face appeared to glaze over as she watched her father, the former president of a major international banking firm, deliver speeches about his future plans for a world of global wealth. 
 "It was a wonderful thing,'' Hillary later recalled. 
 She looked around at her friends, and they looked back at her with the same sad, bored look of old friends.
"We did that when we were young,'' she said. "Then it got weird, but you've got to deal with it.''

Trump, seemingly oblivious to the images of himself and his father being photographed by media, let his eyes fall on a TV screen that displayed a picture of him with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.
  
 
"I love him,'' Trump said. 
The photo was taken in 2005, before Priebus was forced out as chief of staff after a series of racist tweets about the press. 
 "The problem is that he was always on TV, and I knew he was on TV,'' Trump said. "He had the most incredible eyes. And I thought he was a great guy. I thought he was a good guy. I was

 The effect of Trump's fatal stroke on Hillary's public image, and especially on her fellow Senators, and her relationship with both Obama and Clinton, must be one of profound astonishment.
