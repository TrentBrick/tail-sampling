There, the kids had their own room, a small garden, and even a few toys. But you never grew to care for them at all. You weren't even really sure when you were ten how much you should count on them to help you get through the day.

The human body is a complex and flexible organism. We are born with the power to extend our shape, and expand our body, by means of our own body. That power is derived from the whales stomach and it is this capacity to expand itself that makes it so interesting. Once we reach adulthood and reach the age of thirty, we are born with the power to increase the size of our body, and so it was that after a year of being confined within the whale's stomach I was born into the world as a large whale.

First off, redditors are extremely generous with their time to reddit. This means that if an entry has ten or more likes and has not been touched, it is likely to get approved. The more likes, the more likely the post is to get approved. So a very well written entry with multiple likes will get approved, even if it's poorly written! This also happens when you type a link, even if a link is clicked but does not contain a link. This makes it nearly impossible for a submission not to get approved for you by a moderator.

It's been an interesting journey from first idea to reality, but I finally found what I was looking for on January 15th 2011. I was so excited that I had to get a hold of a spare controller and start playing.

I knew a game based on the Unreal Engine based on Unity3D, but I really wanted to be a part of the story that was happening here.

When it came to girls he was very, very confident, but this time his confidence turned out to be a complete joke. He didn't know that they actually felt the same way, but he believed himself to be the better version of them that day.
